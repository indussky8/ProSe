The code is provided for research purposes only and without any warranty. Please cite this paper if you use the code as part of your work.

# Environment

The code is tested on 64-bit Windows with MATLAB R2015a, coming with the pre-compiled mex file "fista_dykastra.mexw64" via Visual Studio 2013.

# Usage

1. Download the Eigen library (versoion 3) from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org, and put the folder "eigen3" in the "SSDS" directory.
2. Compile related functions in the folder "SSDS" based on your architecture. You can run compile.m to complete the compilation in the aforementioned enviroment. 
3. Input the data matrix X to demo_SSDS.m, and run the m-file for Structured Sparse Dictionary Selection.
